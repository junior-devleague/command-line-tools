## What is the Command Line?

The command line, or command line interface (CLI) is a way to interact with the computer. It is a program that takes in commands (text that mean something to the computer) that you type and passes it on to the computer's operating system (the part in your computer that manages all of the software and hardware - aka the Big Boss!) to run.

Previously you may have navigated through folders and files by going on Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on MacOS. In the command line, you can look through folders and files by typing in commands!

Look at the table below. These letters and words may look unfamiliar, but after typing them a lot, you will get the hang of it in no time. Start slow and type accurately!

Some of the descriptions might be confusing at first. Try the commands out by moving through your files, making new files and folders, and listing out what is inside the folders to check if new things have been created. 

Command | Description | Example
--------|-------------|--------
cd [directory] | Change Directory | ```cd Documents``` will switch you into the Documents folder.
cd ..| Move Up One Directory | ```cd ..``` navigates from the current folder to the one above it.
ls | List | ```ls``` will print the names of the stuff in your current folder.
mkdir [name] | Make Directory | ```mkdir newFolder``` will make a new folder called newFolder.
touch [name] | Make a File | ```touch index.html``` will make a new file called index.html.
